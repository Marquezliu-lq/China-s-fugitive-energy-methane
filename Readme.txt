Source data and codes of the forthcoming article by Qiang Liu and Fei Teng, "Dynamic Facility-level Inventory Reveals Peak and Decline of China's Energy Methane Emissions":

Gridded Emission Data (in .tif format):
coal2011-coal2020.tif: Fugitive methane emissions from coal, from 2011 to 2020, at a 25km x 25km resolution.
ONG2011-ONG2020.tif: Fugitive methane emissions from oil and natural gas systems, from 2011 to 2020, at the same resolution.

Original Data (in Excel format):
Coal-Original data.xlsx: Contains mine-specific methane emission details (emission factors, gas levels, mine type, etc.).
ONG-Original data.xlsx: Provides field-specific data for different types of gas and oil fields in China.
Pipe Original data.xlsx: Details about China's long-distance gas and oil pipelines.
Source Data.xlsx: Data supporting the graphs in the article's main text.

Python Codes:
calc.py: Samples parameters from uncertain ranges for emission calculations.
edgar_grid.py: Extracts emission data from the EDGAR inventory for grids within China's boundaries.
Provincial Emission.py: Aggregates gridded emissions to the provincial level.
